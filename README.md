> **Description**: We do believe that the most functions of government should be replaced with more effective and unbiased technologies. The governmental influence on people should be minimized in a maximum possible and safe way, while the most important and necessary governmental functions should become decentrilized and transparent. Blockchain technology promises to catalyze those changes in a financial sector. Let's take baby steps towards AI-technocracy future and help blockchain to evolve. CryptoRatel is our nano-baby-step. Feel free to contribute.
